##Overview
##Background info on Data 
###Project Goals
###Collection Methods
##Data cleanup and critical assesment.
##Exploratory Analysis
##Hypothesies and Questions
###There is a strong inverse correlation between people's wealth and their presence on the “Poor List” in their community.
###There is a correlation between employment type and wealth.
###There may be differences in the likelyhood of being on the Poor List given the same wealth dependent on employment type.
###Wealth, modulated by employment type, predicts health outcomes.
###Being on the Poor List improves health outcomes.
###Can we propose a metric for being on the poor list which we could have an expectation of maximizing quality of life improvment / Cost of benefits
##Analysies
###Create a logistic model to predict presence on poor list.
###Create a health outcome score, and find correlation to wealth and poor list status.
###Create a model which predicts health outcome improvement from being on the poor list.
Plot the improvement in predicted health outcomes vs % of population assigned to the Poor List  by model the model.
